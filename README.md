# Meet

<p>A PWA created and tested using AWS, React, Recharts, Serverless, Jest, and the Google Calendar API.

Created using a test-driven development technique.

Hosted on AWS.

Fetches and displays a list of programming events from the Google Calendar API. Visualizes data using Recharts. 

Users can filter events by city, specify the number of events to display, show/hide event details, and use the app while offline.
